In the Binarization_methods.ipynb notebook, we have tried some binarization methods to figure out with suit the most for this project

In the Character_segmentation_double_line.ipynb, we apply the binarization method (local binary threshold), and after that apply some morphology method then finally find contours to segment the characters on the plate.
